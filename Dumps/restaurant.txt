A small modest clubhouse had one bar and seating for approximately 100 people. When poker machines were first introduced in Queensland the Club purchased nine, and we now have a total of 210. In the early years, the Club was already well established as a bowls club, but with only six of the 248 total members as social members, the Club was to come alive in 1995. From BBQ’s, bingo and baby showers the Club had it all, and with high class entertainment and great meals, it soon became the social hub of Helensvale. North Gold Coast RSL Sub Branch In 2009 Club Helensvale made a decision to host the North Gold Coast RSL Sub Branch Inc and continues to welcome the veterans to the Club. The arrangement has allowed Club Helensvale to become actively involved in community commemorative events like ANZAC and Remembrance Day. Renovations The Club has undertaken a massive facelift over the last twenty years with seven different stages at the cost of $10.25 million. The bistro has been upgraded several times, the gaming room has been moved and renovated several times, the office has been in six different positions, as has the foyer, and new additions over the years include the bowler’s amenities block, the Punt Sports Bar, Café 22 and a new name and image for blu bistro. More recent developments commenced in 2014 with major renovations to the administration moving upstairs, a new porte cochere, staffroom and an extension to our gaming room to include an additional 60 gaming machines, a gaming bar and kitchenette. A new single level carpark was added to the rear of club in 2017. In 2020-21 Club Helensvale has updated the gaming lounge to be more open, spacious and light. The COVID-19 pandemic was a catalyst for making further improvements to our gaming floor, providing a space that allows patrons to adequately social distance and feel comfortable in the surrounds. Our foyer has been extended and offers a grand entrance. The bottle shop is now larger and carries more stock than ever before. In 2022 a new Cafe, Lounge area and Sports Bar were built and by December 2023 Club Helensvale will have a new double-storey Bowlers Lounge with function space above, and a world-class undercover bowling green. Awards In 2004 the club adopted the name “Club Helensvale” with several “Club of the Year” awards through Bowls Queensland and “Best Bowls Clubs” awards from Clubs Queensland to follow. In 2009 we were inducted into the Clubs Queensland Hall of Fame for winning Best Bowls Club three years in a row.

The sports bar has a state-of-the-art sound system and two 98″ screens. The main bar got a facelift and the whole venue has been freshly carpeted. There is a 6m wide television in our lounge area which can be seen from many vantage points around the club. The new Club Helensvale layout is open and bright, creating more seating for dining in our bistro and new furniture in the lounge and café. The next stage of renovations moved outside of the club. Our bowlers building was demolished and a brand new 2-storey building with function space on level 2 was built and open for use in December 2023. One of our new world class undercover carpet bowling greens were unveiled at this time as well, meaning our bowlers can play rain, hail, or shine. The second phase of construction on a new undercover green is well underway and is poised to open late 2024. Progress Report June 2024- Opened in December of 2023, our new world class undercover green, bowlers bar and function centre has seen an influx of new bookings and a support from our members. The function centre boasts a beautiful space for any social or corporate event, with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the green. The alfresco area adjacent to green is a perfect space for bowlers and spectators to relax around games, grab a cold drink and watch all the action unfold. The next undercover green is set to be unveiled by late 2024. June 6th 2023- It’s full steam ahead now! We’re close to the half-way point! The undercover bowling green canopy is starting to go up and concrete has been poured on level 1 of the bowlers/ function building. Carparks are now open along the back fence and a secondary entry is available by walking in between the construction and green 1. More work will commence to widen the road between the bowling greens and the back carpark to allow for 2-way traffic. April 12th- A lot of excavation has been completed and the widening of the entry and exit is starting to take shape. Bottom layer reinforcing and the pouring of footings has been completed. The exciting news is the slab is set to be poured next week! Our main bathrooms are currently undergoing their makeover and we are starting to narrow down our kids outdoor play areas. February 9th- The ground has been levelled. This was a big part of the project, bringing green 2 down to the same level as green 1 and adjacent to the clubhouse. Rocks have been removed and the widening of the road and carpark has commenced. Soon the exit will be the clubs entry point as well. No more driving through the loading dock! Inside the club we are about to lose our uniform shop and main toilets. This area will be blocked off while new toilets are built which will service the new and existing buildings. December 12th 2022 – The entire bowlers building has been demolished! Green 2 is now out of action for the bowlers. November 18th – Inside of the club has been completed and we await the arrival of our new 6m TV due in early December. Demolition of the bowlers building will start in a week and we have lights being installed onto green 1 next week as well. This will be great for barefoot bowls through the Summer. October 30th – the 2nd stage of our renovations is all but completed. We have the brand-new Café Discovery open to the public with new tables and chairs conveniently located next to the Blu Bistro. The Sports Bar has been moved to the opposite side of the bar and has 2 new 98′ TV’s as the area’s hero pieces. Where our old Café 22 was formally located; that raised area has now been removed, new carpet has been laid and we’ve got beautiful new lounge furniture finishing off that area nicely. It’s open and more spacious. The Blu Bistro once had a raised seating area; that was removed and has created a lot more space. Our Melbourne Cup Luncheon had 220 people in the room comfortably. Our kid’s area has been re-carpeted and is open for use. BOWLING FACILITIES Club Helensvale is an industry leader for the sport of bowls and with the newest addition of a state-of-the-art covered bowling green, our members and guests will be able to bowl rain hail or shine! Set for completion in late 2024, a second undercover green is set to be unveiled, enhancing our facilities even further! In total Club Helensvale will have 3 top class greens with all the required amenities for additional comfort. Members and guests can relax and unwind in the stylish bowler’s bar and alfresco area or head inside for the Club facilities including our restaurant, café, gaming and sports bar.

We’re excited to see our reach spreading to new organisations since the re-introduction of the Community Benefit Fund in 2021, with first time recipients Gold Coast Tweed Motorsports, Coomera Netball Club and Coomera Hope Island Cricket Club submitting successful applications. Organisations which are already part of the Club Helensvale family, Helensvale Netball, Helensvale Hornets JRL, Pimpama Swimming and Arundel Ride for the Disabled round out the successful applicants for January 2024. Some of the projects we are funding in round 6 will benefit a wide range of the local community. Arundel Ride for the Disabled will be using their funding for new shade structures for the horses at their complex just off Brisbane Road in Arundel. The Coomera Hope Island Cricket Club are fundraising to replace their synthetic turf in the bowling nets to reduce the risk of injury bowling on concrete and the Pimpama Swimming Club, who were only established in 2023, and are now forming representative teams to compete and require new uniforms for coaches and athletes. Almost $5000 will be used by organisations to upgrade their equipment such as sporting balls and first aid kits. Club Helensvale has also donated $10,000 to the ClubsCare initiative by Clubs Queensland to support those in need after the devastating weather events we have witnessed across QLD in the past couple of months. We are also donating $1 from all seniors meals and lunch specials which we estimate will be a further $2000 to the cause. Our next round of Community Benefit Funding will open in May and be advertised on our website and social media channels. Club Helensvale is committed to donating $50,000 per year to our local community through the Community Benefit Fund but will also continue supporting local charities, organisations and not-for-profit groups with free room hire and fundraising assistance throughout the year.
